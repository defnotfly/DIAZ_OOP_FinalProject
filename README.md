# Management Hotel Booking System

## Overview

The **Management Hotel Booking System** is a Java-based console application that allows users to book hotel rooms conveniently. It provides a smooth experience for selecting room types, validating user inputs, calculating total costs, and generating booking details, ensuring a user-friendly approach to managing hotel reservations.

This system is a demonstration of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

## Code Structure

### Class Descriptions

1. **`Room` (Abstract Class)**
   - Represents the generic concept of a hotel room.
   - Fields: `name`, `description`, `price`.
   - Methods:
     - `displayRoom()`: Displays room details.
     - `getDetails()`: Abstract method to fetch room-specific features.

2. **Room Subclasses**
   - **`StandardRoom`**
   - **`DeluxeRoom`**
   - **`PresidentialSuite`**
   Each subclass implements `getDetails()` to provide specific room amenities.

3. **`Hotel`**
   - Manages the booking process, including input validation, cost calculations, and generating client details.
   - Handles:
     - User input (name, phone number, dates, room selection).
     - Payment validation and change calculation.
     - Displaying booking information.

4. **`ManagementHotelBookingSystem`**
   - Main class to run the application.
   - Handles the initialization of room types and orchestrates the booking process.

## OOP Principles in the Code

1. **Polymorphism**
   - The method `getDetails()` is overridden in the subclasses (`StandardRoom`, `DeluxeRoom`, `PresidentialSuite`) to provide room-specific details. When you call `getDetails()` on a `Room` object, Java will execute the correct version of the method depending on the actual object type (e.g., `StandardRoom`, `DeluxeRoom`).

2. **Inheritance**
   - `StandardRoom`, `DeluxeRoom`, and `PresidentialSuite` extend the `Room` class. These subclasses inherit the properties and methods of the `Room` class and override the `getDetails()` method to provide specific room features.

3. **Encapsulation**
   - The `Hotel` class encapsulates customer details and booking information, ensuring that data is hidden and accessed through getter and setter methods. The class provides a controlled interface for interacting with the user's booking data.

4. **Abstraction**
   - The `Room` class is abstract, and its abstract method `getDetails()` is implemented by the subclasses. This allows for a generic `Room` type while allowing different room types to provide their own specific implementations of `getDetails()`.
